    <h1 align="center">Hello!</h1>
    <p align="center">
            Let me introduce myself, I'm Viktor Miskolczi, 29 years old, I'm a freight forwarder and I'm currently studying web programming. I have studied programming (C) before, but unfortunately life has taken me down a different path and after more than 10 years I would like to learn the mysteries of web programming. In the future I would like to create modern websites.
